# Paraphrase-Mining 
Is the `task of finding paraphrases` (texts with identical / similar meaning) `in a large corpus` `of sentences`.

Given a list of sentences / texts, this function performs paraphrase mining. It `compares all sentences against all other sentences` and `returns a list with the pairs` that `have the highest cosine similarity score`.
